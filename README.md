# OpenCV Python Docs

I wasn't able to find complete documentation for OpenCV's Python API anywhere, so I used [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html) to generate it.

[The result is on GitHub Pages here.](http://madebyollin.github.io/opencv-python-docs)

pydoc generates _very_ dated markup (`<font>, <big>...`), so I modified the pydoc script to generate (slightly) more semantic markup.

The output is still very poor compared to proper documentation (crammed onto a single page, many links broken), but it's good enough to `ctrl + f` through for method signatures.
